# Container

In this project, you will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template
library.
You have to take the structure of each standard container as reference. If a part of
the Orthodox Canonical form is missing in it, do not implement it.
As a reminder, you have to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of
the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated
ones) is expected.
